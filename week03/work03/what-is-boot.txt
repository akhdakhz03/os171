Hello, this is explanation about booting

Assuming that the machine is running with BIOS and GRub as bootloader.
the step process of booting explained below :
1. Power on : BIOS POST execution
when you switch on your computer, it will read bios instructions.
then bios will check presence of hardware devices

2.Reading the CMOS and choose the bootable device
then bios will check user setting in CMOS memory and start first available 
boot device from the bios settings list

3. Grub stage 1
Bios load the MB In memory if it is not corrupted.
Bios executes the instructions of the primary boot loader code (grub stage 1)

4. Grub stage 1.5
Grub stage 1 loads the content of the MBR GAP.
Grub stage 1 passes the control to Grub 1.5 which includes driver to 
read ext2 partition.

5. Grub stage 2
Grub stage 1.5 open the active partition and load Grub stage 2.
Grub stage 1.5 passes the control to Grub stage 2.

6. kernel boot execution
Grub loads the selected kernel image from boot folder ( vmlinuz).
Grub executes the first part of the kernel code.
The kernel header setup the environment to pass the CPU In protected mode.
The kernel header decompress the rest of the kernel image, and execute it in protected mode.
Finally, the init process is launched.
